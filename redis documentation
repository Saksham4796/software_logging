Step1 : Download redis from https://redis.io/download
Step2 : tar xvzf redis-6.2.3.tar.gz
Step3 : cd redis-6.2.3
Step4 : make

Now to find redis benchmarks:
Refer to the webpage : https://www.tutorialspoint.com/redis/redis_benchmarks.htm

To run Redis with the default configuration, just type:

Step1:   cd src
Step2:   ./redis-server

If you want to provide your redis.conf, you have to run it using an additional parameter (the path of the configuration file):

STep1: cd src
Step2: ./redis-server /path/to/redis.conf

It is possible to alter the Redis configuration by passing parameters directly as options using the command line. 

Step1: ./redis-server --port 9999 --replicaof 127.0.0.1 6379
Step2: ./redis-server /etc/redis/6379.conf --loglevel debug

To get the output for no-verbose logging , the following command can be executed:
Step1: Run this command in one terminal - src/redis-server redis.conf --loglevel notice > notice.log 2>&1
Step2: Run this command in a new terminal - src/redis-benchmark -q -n 100
Step3: Stop the first terminal using Ctrl+C

Now to get the output for verbose logging , the following command can be executed:
Step1: Run this command in one terminal - src/redis-server redis.conf --loglevel verbose > verbose.log 2>&1
Step2: Run this command in a new terminal - src/redis-benchmark -q -n 100
Step3: Stop the first terminal using Ctrl+C

Now, we can compare the notice.log and verbose.log files to observe the difference between loglevel notice and loglevel verbose.

Few Points:
1. The following command was used to find out if redis was intsalled using apt-get package manager - "dpkg -l | grep redis" . The "ii" in the beginning of the output shows that the library was pre-installed using apt-get package manager.
2. The following command was used to stop the redis which was pre-installed using apt-get package manager - "sudo systemctl stop redis"
3. The following command was used to disable the redis which was pre-installed using apt-get package manager - "sudo systemctl disable redis"
